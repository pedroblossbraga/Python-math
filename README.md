# Python-math-study: Some codes in Python, with a Mathematical approach

- hypotenyses: Find the hypotenuse!
A code that finds a number the hypotenyse in a certain given range of numbers, satisfying the Pitagorean Theorem.

- Mini prompt: A interpreter of simple arithmetic expressions, using abstract data-types for storage, posfix and prefix notation converters. It calculates expressions and assignes values to variables, of numbers in the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

- binary: A program with a converter from number to binary, and a function that gives back the number if given the list of divisions and remainders in the binary operation.

- classificador_de_arquivos ("Archive classifier"): This program generates a file with various names, birth-dates and IDs, and classifies it, recording it classified in a output file, and plots a graph of time performance of each of the 3 used classification algorithms (sort(), Quick-Recursive, Quick-Non-Recursive).
